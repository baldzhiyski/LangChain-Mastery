# ðŸ§© LangChain & RAG Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises, code snippets, and experiments designed to **understand and practice LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation in how to integrate **LLMs with external knowledge sources** for more accurate and context-aware AI applications.
